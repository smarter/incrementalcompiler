/**
 * Extracts simple names used in given compilation unit.
 *
 * Extracts simple (unqualified) names mentioned in given in non-definition position by collecting
 * all symbols associated with non-definition trees and extracting names from all collected symbols.
 *
 * If given symbol is mentioned both in definition and in non-definition position (e.g. in member
 * selection) then that symbol is collected. It means that names of symbols defined and used in the
 * same compilation unit are extracted. We've considered not extracting names of those symbols
 * as an optimization strategy. It turned out that this is not correct.  Check
 * https://github.com/gkossakowski/sbt/issues/3 for an example of scenario where it matters.
 *
 * All extracted names are returned in _decoded_ form. This way we stay consistent with the rest
 * of incremental compiler which works with names in decoded form.
 *
 * Names mentioned in Import nodes are handled properly but require some special logic for two
 * reasons:
 *
 *   1. import node itself has a term symbol associated with it with a name `<import`>.
 *      I (gkossakowski) tried to track down what role this symbol serves but I couldn't.
 *      It doesn't look like there are many places in Scala compiler that refer to
 *      that kind of symbols explicitly.
 *   2. ImportSelector is not subtype of Tree therefore is not processed by `Tree.foreach`
 *
 * Another type of tree nodes that requires special handling is TypeTree. TypeTree nodes
 * has a little bit odd representation:
 *
 *   1. TypeTree.hasSymbol always returns false even when TypeTree.symbol
 *      returns a symbol
 *   2. The original tree from which given TypeTree was derived is stored
 *      in TypeTree.original but Tree.forech doesn't walk into original
 *      tree so we missed it
 *
 * The tree walking algorithm walks into TypeTree.original explicitly.
